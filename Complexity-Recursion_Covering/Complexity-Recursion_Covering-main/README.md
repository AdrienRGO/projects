# Complexity and recursion: Distribution and spatial overlap

## **1. About this project**

This problem is a **space covering problem**.   
We will therefore use **recursivity** to solve it. Also, the objective is to **optimize the code** by finding the number of exact solutions as fast as possible and thus **reducing the complexity**.
