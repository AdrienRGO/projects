## **1. About this project**

This project aimed at learning Python and more precisely **object-oriented programming** with the management of classes, attributes, functions...  
It was also a first introduction to dictionaries.
This project was done in a school setting with another classmate.  

The idea behind this project is quite simple. Indeed, from a DB under excel file, we try to **find and match all the elements that meet one or more conditions** to know :
  - **The type of the commodity**
  - **The group to which the commodity in question belongs**
  - **The location of the harvest**
  - **The unit of measurement**

To start the project, we first created the classes and elements associated with the class diagram. Once we had this base, we tried to **understand and relate all these classes**.
